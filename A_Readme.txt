The provided python script 'Classifier_Final' was used to obtain all report results.

Each csv file is a different classifier models results when applied to the test data.

The appended filename extension '_xx' indicates which classifier produced the results.

The '_xg' file is the best performing model as per the kaggle leaderboard.

** How to run the script **
1. Change the 'test_data_path' and 'train_data_path' variables  on line 54 and 55 to the appropriate file directory.
2. Change the 'best_model' variable  on line 176 to the desired 'final' model you are aiming to reproduce as a csv. These models are those labelled after line 135 (except for dummy classifier which has to be manually inputted).
Optional: Change the output csv file name on line 185 to append the extension to the file name.
